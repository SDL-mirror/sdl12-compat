To compile and install SDL:

    1.  Point CMake ( http://www.cmake.org/ ) at this directory. Generate
        a project file of your liking and build.

    2.  Look at the example programs in ./test, and check out the HTML
        documentation in ./docs to see how to use the SDL library.

    3.  Join the SDL developer forums at https://discourse.libsdl.org/

That's it!
